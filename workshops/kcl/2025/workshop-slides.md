Summary

**Definition**: The ability of software to endure.

**Useful for us because**: We want our research software to have
continued impact.

**Achieved by**:

| Usability and Interoperability | Services         | HTTP requests can be made **easily** and from **any language**.             |
| Portability and Scalability    | Containerisation | Docker containers can be **run anywhere** and can be **replicated**.        |

**Note**: Sustainable (i.e. environmentally friendly) software is
important too!

Teaching format

The online material, which you have already reviewed, is the
‘**lecture**’.

- Available on **YouTube** (recorded offline and via live stream).

- Catch up as quickly as you can if you have not yet reviewed this
  material.

Today is the ‘**tutorial**’.

- A **workshop** in which we further explore the ideas from the course.

Links to all material available at:
[**github.com/martinteaching/sustainability**](https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability).

Workshop structure

A series of five 50-minute sessions. Each session will relate to one of
the five topics covered in the course:

<div class="centering">

|   **Time**    |  **Activity**   |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| 10.00 - 10.10 | *Introduction*  |
| 10.10 - 10.50 | Coding practice |
| 10.50 - 11.00 |     *Break*     |
| 11.00 - 11.50 | Version control |
| 11.50 - 12.00 |     *Break*     |
| 12.00 - 12.50 |     Testing     |
| 12.50 - 14.00 |     *Lunch*     |
| 14.00 - 14.50 |    Services     |
| 14.50 - 15.00 |     *Break*     |
| 15.00 - 15.50 |     Docker      |
| 15.50 - 16.00 |     *Close*     |

</div>

There is an **exercise** available for each session, based on the
current topic.

The first part of each session will give you time **individually** to
review and make a start on the exercise.

The second will be a **collaborative** coding session, during which we
will construct an answer to the exercise together.

- I will share a *Visual Studio Code* link.

- We will take it in turns to be **in charge of the editor**, with those
  not currently coding **helping with the solution**.

Assessment

A requirement for the workshop.

Please **engage sufficiently with the collaborative coding sessions** in
order to receive a ‘pass’ mark.

Technology Drift

The material for this course was recorded a **little while ago**, which
might seem strange for any technology-related workshop, given that
technologies change all the time.

Because the topics we focus on are so **fundamental**, the course
doesn’t suffer too much from this *technology drift*. However, there are
some **notable changes** from when the material was recorded:

- `docker-compose` to `docker compose`

- I used to *love* semicolons...

I am **continually reviewing** whether the material needs to be
re-recorded.

</div>

<div class="frame">

A quick word on how I like to run sessions...

I am more of a **generalist** (‘jack of all trades’) than a
**specialist**.

Therefore, likely people here who know **way more** about aspects of
this technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things – I am
very open to **learning more**.

Most importantly, collaborate and help **each other**.

KCLHI and software sustainability: microservices

A **microservice architecture** is really what we are building towards
in this course, as they epitomise sustainable software.

An approach we use in our group, King’s College London Health
Informatics (KCLHI).

Examples:

- ‘**Phenoflow**’ -

- ‘**REFLECT**’ -
