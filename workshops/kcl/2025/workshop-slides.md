The online material, which you have already reviewed, is the
'**lecture**'.

-   Available on **YouTube** (recorded offline and via live stream).

-   Catch up as quickly as you can if you have not yet reviewed this
    material.

Today is the '**tutorial**'.

-   A **workshop** in which we further explore the ideas from the
    course.

Workshop structure

A series of five 50-minute sessions. Each session will relate to one of
the five topics covered in the course:

::: centering
     **Time**       **Activity**
  --------------- -----------------
   10.00 - 10.10   *Introduction*
   10.10 - 10.50   Coding practice
   10.50 - 11.00       *Break*
   11.00 - 11.50   Version control
   11.50 - 12.00       *Break*
   12.00 - 12.50       Testing
   12.50 - 14.00       *Lunch*
   14.00 - 14.50      Services
   14.50 - 15.00       *Break*
   15.00 - 15.50       Docker
   15.50 - 16.00       *Close*
:::

There is an **exercise** available for each session, based on the
current topic.

The first part of each session will give you time **individually** to
review and make a start on the exercise.

The second will be a **collaborative** coding session, during which we
will construct an answer to the exercise together.

-   I will share a *Visual Studio Code* link.

-   We will take it in turns to be **in charge of the editor**, with
    those not currently coding **helping with the solution**.

Assessment

A requirement for the workshop.

Please **engage sufficiently with the collaborative coding sessions** in
order to receive a 'pass' mark.

Technology Drift

The material for this course was recorded a **little while ago**, which
might seem strange for any technology-related workshop, given that
technologies change all the time.

Because the topics we focus on are so **fundamental**, the course
doesn't suffer too much from this *technology drift*. However, there are
some **notable changes** from when the material was recorded:

-   `docker-compose`{.bash} to `docker compose`{.bash}

-   I used to *love* semicolons\...

I am **continually reviewing** whether the material needs to be
re-recorded.

A quick word on how I like to run sessions\...

I am more of a **generalist** ('jack of all trades') than a
**specialist**.

Therefore, likely people here who know **way more** about aspects of
this technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things -- I am
very open to **learning more**.

Most importantly, collaborate and help **each other**.

KCLHI and software sustainability: microservices

A **microservice architecture** is really what we are building towards
in this course, as they epitomise sustainable software.

An approach we use in our group, King's College London Health
Informatics (KCLHI).
