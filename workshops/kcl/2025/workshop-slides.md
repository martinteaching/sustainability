The [**online
material**](https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability#material),
which you have hopefully already reviewed, is the ‘**lecture**’.

- Available on **YouTube** (recorded offline and via live stream).

- If you have not yet had an opportunity to review this material, there
  will be **time today** to do so.

Today is the ‘**tutorial**’.

- A
  [**workshop**](https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability/tree/master/workshops/kcl/2025)
  in which we further explore the ideas from the course.

Summary: Software sustainability

**Definition**: The ability of software to **endure**.

**Useful for us because**: We want our research software to have
**continued impact**.

**Achieved by**:

| **Property**                   | **Realisation**           | **Example**                                                                 |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maintainability                | Coding practice           | Comments = **understandable** code.                                         |
| Extensibility                  | Version control           | Git provides a **path of updates**.                                         |
| Trust                          | Testing                   | Unit tests can show that our code works in a **wide number of situations**. |
| Usability and Interoperability | Services                  | HTTP requests can be made **easily** and from **any language**.             |
| Portability and Scalability    | Containerisation (Docker) | Docker containers can be **run anywhere** and can be **replicated**.        |

**Note**: Sustainable (i.e. environmentally friendly) software is
important too!

Workshop structure

A series of **five 50-minute sessions**. Each session will relate to one
of the five topics covered in the course:

<div class="centering">

|   **Time**    |  **Activity**   |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| 10.00 - 10.10 | *Introduction*  |
| 10.10 - 10.50 | Coding practice |
| 10.50 - 11.00 |     *Break*     |
| 11.00 - 11.50 | Version control |
| 11.50 - 12.00 |     *Break*     |
| 12.00 - 12.50 |     Testing     |
| 12.50 - 14.00 |     *Lunch*     |
| 14.00 - 14.50 |    Services     |
| 14.50 - 15.00 |     *Break*     |
| 15.00 - 15.50 |     Docker      |

Exercises

There is an
[**exercise**](https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability/blob/master/workshops/kcl/2025/workshop-exercises.md)
available for each session, based on the current topic.

The first part of each session will give you time **individually** to
review and make a start on the exercise using [GitHub
Codespaces](https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability/tree/master/workshops/kcl/2025#github-codespaces-recommended).

- Also time to **catch up on the online material** for the current topic
  if needed.

- Focus on the **‘in practice’** videos.

The second will be a **collaborative** coding session, during which we
will construct an answer to the exercise together.

- I will share a *Visual Studio Code* **Live Share** link (with
  ‘*at-keyboard*’ coding as a backup).

- We will take it in turns to be **in charge of the editor**, with those
  not currently coding **helping with the solution**.

Assessment

A requirement for the workshop.

Please **engage sufficiently with the collaborative coding sessions** in
order to receive a ‘pass’ mark.

Technology Drift

The material for this course was recorded a **little while ago**, which
might seem strange for any technology-related workshop, given that
technologies change all the time.

Because the topics we focus on are so **fundamental**, the course
doesn’t suffer too much from this *technology drift*. However, there are
some **notable changes** from when the material was recorded:

- `docker-compose` to `docker compose`

- I used to *love* semicolons...

I am **continually reviewing** whether the material needs to be
re-recorded.

</div>

<div class="frame">

A quick word on how I like to run sessions...

I am more of a **generalist** (‘jack of all trades’) than a
**specialist**.

Therefore, likely people here who know **way more** about aspects of
this technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things – I am
very open to **learning more**.

Most importantly, collaborate and help **each other**.

KCLHI and software sustainability: microservices

A **microservice architecture** is really what we are building towards
in this course, as they epitomise sustainable software.

An approach we use in our group, King’s College London Health
Informatics (KCLHI).

- [kclhi.org](https://kclhi.org).

- [github.com/kclhi](https://github.com/kclhi).

Examples:

- ‘**Phenoflow**’ -

- ‘**REFLECT**’ -
  [github.com/kclreflect](https://github.com/kclreflect).

- ‘**CONSULT**’ -

- ‘**TMRWeb**’ -
