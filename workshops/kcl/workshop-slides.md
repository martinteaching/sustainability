Forums

Exercise rooms, on **Teams**:

1.  To be joined during the exercise sections of the workshop (live
    stream pauses). Ask for help from me, and from your peers.

**Slack**:

1.  For asking questions in text throughout, and if everything goes
    wrong.

**YouTube live**, where we are now:

1.  The day will be coordinated from here, and will be where the
    solution to each stage of the exercise is shown.

2.  Questions asked in the first two fora will inform what's discussed
    here (be aware of stream delays).

Structure

Assessment

A requirement for the workshop.

**Highlighted in the exercises**, including submission and marking
process.

Please complete by the **end of the week**, to receive a mark.

A quick word on how I like to run sessions\...

I never consider myself an expert. Always an **enthusiast**.

Likely people here who know **way more** about aspects of this
technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things - I am
here to **learn too**.

Most importantly, collaborate and help **each other**.
