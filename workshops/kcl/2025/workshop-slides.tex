\begin{frame}[fragile]{Summary}

\textbf{Definition}: The ability of software to endure.

\textbf{Useful for us because}: We want our research software to have continued impact.

\textbf{Achieved by}:

\begin{center}
    \input{tables/software-sustainability.tex}
\end{center}

\textbf{Note}: Sustainable (i.e. environmentally friendly) software is important too!

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Teaching format}

The online material, which you have already reviewed, is the `\textbf{lecture}'.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Available on \textbf{YouTube} (recorded offline and via live stream).

    \item Catch up as quickly as you can if you have not yet reviewed this material.

\end{itemize}

Today is the `\textbf{tutorial}'.

\begin{itemize}

    \item A \textbf{workshop} in which we further explore the ideas from the course.

\end{itemize}

Links to all material available at:
\href{https://github.com/martinteaching/sustainability}{\textbf{github.com/martinteaching/sustainability}}.

\end{frame}

%==============================

\begin{frame}[fragile, allowframebreaks]{Workshop structure}

A series of five 50-minute sessions.
Each session will relate to one of the five topics covered in the course:

\begin{centering}

\begin{table}[h!]

    \centering

    \input{tables/workshop-schedule}

\end{table}

\end{centering}

\framebreak

There is an \textbf{exercise} available for each session, based on the current topic.

The first part of each session will give you time \textbf{individually} to review and make a start on the exercise.

The second will be a \textbf{collaborative} coding session, during which we will construct an answer to the exercise together.

\begin{itemize}

  \item I will share a \emph{Visual Studio Code} link.

  \item We will take it in turns to be \textbf{in charge of the editor}, with those not currently coding \textbf{helping with the solution}.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%==============================

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Assessment}

A requirement for the workshop.

Please \textbf{engage sufficiently with the collaborative coding sessions} in order to receive a `pass' mark.

\end{frame}

%==============================

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Technology Drift}

The material for this course was recorded a \textbf{little while ago}, which might seem strange for any technology-related workshop, given that technologies change all the time.

Because the topics we focus on are so \textbf{fundamental}, the course doesn't suffer too much from this \emph{technology drift}.
However, there are some \textbf{notable changes} from when the material was recorded:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \mintinline[bgcolor=bg]{bash}{docker-compose} to \mintinline[bgcolor=bg]{bash}{docker compose}
    \item I used to \emph{love} semicolons...
\end{itemize}

I am \textbf{continually reviewing} whether the material needs to be re-recorded.

\end{frame}

%==============================

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A quick word on how I like to run sessions...}

I am more of a \textbf{generalist} (`jack of all trades') than a \textbf{specialist}.

Therefore, likely people here who know \textbf{way more} about aspects of this technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things -- I am very open to \textbf{learning more}.

Most importantly, collaborate and help \textbf{each other}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{KCLHI and software sustainability: microservices}

A \textbf{microservice architecture} is really what we are building towards in this course, as they epitomise sustainable software.

An approach we use in our group, King's College London Health Informatics (KCLHI).
