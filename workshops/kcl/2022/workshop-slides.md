There is an **exercise** available for each session, based on the
current topic.

The first part of each session will **individually** give you time to
review and make a start on the exercise.

The second will be a **collaborative** coding session, during which we
will construct an answer to the exercise together.

-   I will share a *JupyterLab* link via Teams.

-   We will take it in turns to be **in charge of the editor**, with
    those not currently coding **helping with the solution**.

Assessment

A requirement for the workshop.

Please **engage sufficiently with the interactive coding sessions** in
order to receive a 'pass' mark.

A quick word on how I like to run sessions\...

I never consider myself an expert. Always an **enthusiast**.

Likely people here who know **way more** about aspects of this
technology than I do.

Correct me, challenge me and tell me better ways to do things -- I am
here to **learn too**.

Most importantly, collaborate and help **each other**.

KCLHI and software sustainability: microservices

A **microservice architecture** is really what we are building towards
in this course, as they epitomise sustainable software.

An approach we use in our group, King's College London Health
Informatics (KCLHI).
